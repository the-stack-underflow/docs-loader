An address incompatible with the requested protocol was used. All sockets are created with an associated address family (that is, AF.INET for Internet Protocols) and a generic protocol type (that is, SOCK.STREAM).

This error occurs if an application attempts to bind a socket to an IP address/port that has already been used for an existing socket, or a socket that was not closed properly, or one that is still in the process of closing. For server applications that need to bind multiple sockets to the same port number, consider using setsockopt (SO.REUSEADDR). Client applications usually need not call bind at all—connect chooses an unused port automatically. When bind is called with a wildcard address (involving ADDR_ANY), a WSAEADDRINUSE error could be delayed until the specific address is committed. This could happen with a call to another function later, including connect, listen, WSAConnect, or WSAJoinLeaf. </p> </div></div><div><div class=mobile-scroll-container><pre class="fieldHasDocs scroll-item">WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL = <span class=tok-number>WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL</span>,</pre></div><div class=fieldDocs><p> Cannot assign requested address.

The requested name is valid and was found in the database, but it does not have the correct associated data being resolved for. The usual example for this is a host name-to-address translation attempt (using gethostbyname or WSAAsyncGetHostByName) which uses the DNS (Domain Name Server). An MX record is returned but no A record—indicating the host itself exists, but is not directly reachable. </p> </div></div><div><div class=mobile-scroll-container><pre class="fieldHasDocs scroll-item">WSA_QOS_RECEIVERS = <span class=tok-number>WSA_QOS_RECEIVERS</span>,</pre></div><div class=fieldDocs><p> QoS receivers.
